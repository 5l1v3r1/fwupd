# The path where we search for .cab files
#
# IMPORTANT: the files we could process are deleted from this location when
# they have been signed successfully.
#
# You will need to modify the permissions on this directory so that the signd
# user can read from this location, e.g.
#    # chown fwsignd:fwsignd /srv/fwsignd/source
#
# If you are running as non-root, you probably also want to do something like:
#    # chmod g+s /srv/fwsignd/source
SourceDirectory=/srv/fwsignd/source

# The path where we write new signed .cab files
#
# You will need to modify the permissions on this directory so that the signd
# user can write to this location, e.g.
#    # chown fwsignd:fwsignd /srv/fwsignd/destination -R
DestinationDirectory=/srv/fwsignd/destination

# The GPG key ID used for signing -- you probably want to create a key without
# a password, e.g.
#    # useradd temp
#    # su -l temp
#    $ gpg2 --full-gen-key
#    $ gpg2 --list-secret-keys
#    $ gpg2 --edit-key 12345678
#    gpg> passwd
#    gpg> quit
#    # cp /home/temp/.gnupg /var/lib/fwsignd/ -Rv
#    # chown fwsignd:fwsignd /var/lib/fwsignd/.gnupg -R
KeyID=12345678

# Set the destination files to the same user and group as the source files
#
# This requires that the fwsignd binary is being run as the root user.
